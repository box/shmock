 * checks that will apply to every mock object you create using Shmock Policies.

     * Create an instance of a mock object. Shmock uses a build / replay model for building mock objects.
     * The third argument to the create method is a callable that acts as the mock's build phase. The resulting
     * object from the create method is the object in the replay phase.
     *
     * Sample usage:
     * <pre>
     * // build a mock of MyCalculator, expecting a call to add
     * // with arguments [1,2] and return the value 3, exactly once.
     *
     * $mock = \Shmock\Shmock::create($this, 'MyCalculator', function ($calc) {
     *   $calc->add(1,2)->return_value(3);
     * });
     * </pre>
     *
     * In the example above, the invocation target of the method <code>add(1,2)</code>
     * is an of \Shmock\Instance. This instance will allow you to mock any
     * instance method on the class MyCalculator, so it might allow <code>add</code> or <code>subtract</code>,
     * but not <code>openFileStream()</code> or <code>sbutract</code>. The result of the method
     * is an instance of \Shmock\PHPUnitSpec, which contains many of the familiar
     * expectation-setting methods for mock frameworks.
     *
     * You may easily design your own build / replay lifecycle to meet your needs by
     * using the Instance and StaticClass classes directly.
     *
     * <pre>
     * $shmock = new \Shmock\Instance($this, 'MyCalculator');
     * $shmock->add(1,2)->return_value(3);
     * $mock = $shmock->replay();
     * </pre>
